# WP Admin Task Manager
WP Admin Task Manager Plugin helps WordPress site admins and developers manage internal tasks, development notes, and maintenance reminders directly within the dashboard. Create, view, edit, and delete tasks to stay organized and keep your site on track — all without leaving WordPress.

🔌 Plugin Name: Admin Todo List
✅ Problem It Solves:
WordPress admins, developers, or content editors often need to keep track of:

Bug fixes

Site updates

Plugin/theme changes

Content tasks

General reminders

Most people manage these tasks externally (Google Docs, Notion, sticky notes), which is disconnected from the actual site. This plugin brings that task tracking inside the WordPress dashboard, right where you work.

🎯 Key Features (All Admin-Only CRUD)
1. Create Tasks
Add a new todo item with:

Task title

Description/notes

Due date

Priority (Low, Medium, High)

Status (Pending, In Progress, Done)

Assigned To (optional dropdown of WP users)

2. Read Tasks (Task List Table)
View all tasks in a sortable/filterable list:

Filter by status or priority

Sort by due date

Show overdue tasks in red

3. Update Tasks
Edit title, notes, due date, priority, status, or assignee

4. Delete Tasks
Remove completed or obsolete tasks
